/**

 * First, the forEach() method requires a Consumer instance. Supplier<Double> can be
 * immediately discarded because Supplier<Double> does not inherit Consumer. For
 * this same reason, option DoubleConsummer is also incorrect. DoubleConsumer does not inherit
 * from Consumer. In this manner, primitive functional interfaces cannot be used
 * in the forEach() method. Consummer seems correct, since forEach() does take a
 * Consumer instance, but it is missing a generic argument. Without the generic
 * argument, the lambda expression does not compile because the expression pË‚5
 * cannot be applied to an Object. Consummer<Integer> is also close. However, a Double
 * cannot be passed to an Integer. The correct functional interface is
 * Consumer<Double>, and since that is not available
