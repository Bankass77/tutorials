/**
 * 
 * The key to this question is keeping track of the types. Line 24 is a
 * Map<Integer, Integer>. Line 25 builds a List out of a Set of Entry objects,
 * giving us List<Entry<Integer, Integer>>. This causes a compile error on line
 * 31 since we can't multiply an Entry object by two.
 * 
 * Lines 26â€“29 are all of type List<Integer>. The first three are immutable, and
 * the one on line 24 is mutable. This means line 32 throws an
 * UnsupportedOperationException since we attempt to modify the list. Line 33
 * would work if we could get to it. Since there is one compiler error and one
 * runtime error
