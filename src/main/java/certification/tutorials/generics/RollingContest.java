/**
 * 
 * The Roller class uses a formal type parameter named E with a constraint. The
 * key to this question is knowing that with generics, the extends keyword means
 * any subclass or the class can be used as the type parameter. This means both
 * Wheel and CartWheel are allowed. The wheel1 declaration is fine because the
 * same type is used on both sides of the declaration. The wheel2 declaration
 * does not compile because generics require the exact same type when not using
 * wildcards. The wheel3 and wheel4 declarations are both fine because this time
 * there is an upper bound to specify that the type can be a subclass. By
 * contrast, the super keyword means it has to be that class or a superclass.
 * The wheel6 declaration is okay, but the wheel5 one is a problem because it
 * uses a subclass. Since wheel2 and wheel5 donâ€™t compile
 *
