 * The code doesnâ€™t compile. The first compilation
 * error is on line 29. Since Rodent declares at least one constructor and it is
 * not a no-argument constructor, Beaver must declare a constructor with an
 * explicit call to a super() constructor. Line 31 contains two compilation
 * errors. First, the return types are not covariant since Number is a
 * supertype, not a subtype, of Integer. Second, the inherited method is static,
 * but the overridden method is not, making this an invalid override. The code
 * contains three compilation errors
