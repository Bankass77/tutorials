Builder Pattern
checklist:
To implement builder pattern with director we have to:
- declare builder interface
- create multiple builders
- create director that can work with different builders
- In client code instantiate director and  concrete implementation of builder to build new objects

TO implement builder pattern with chain method calls we have to:
 - Create inner Builder class inside type that we want to build
 - implement method in type that return reference to the builder object
 - Declare setters in builder that returns the reference to this builder object
 - Implement build() method to terminate method chain and return target object
 - In client code call method to get reference to builder and build object step-by-step
