  Prototype Pattern
  Checklist:
  To implement Prototype Pattern:
  
  - Add clone() method to hierarchy of our objects.
  - Design a registry that maintains a cache of prototypical objects
  - Design API that allows to clone  object clone inside the factory and return new object as a result.
  - Use factory API instead of NEW keyword to instantiate the objects
