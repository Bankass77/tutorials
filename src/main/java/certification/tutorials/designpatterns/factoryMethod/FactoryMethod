 Factory Method Pattern 
 Checklist: 
 
 To implement Factory Method  pattern:
 1- Define hierachy of object 
 2- Design the arguments for the factory method. Think about qualities or characteristics
 that are necessary and sufficient to identify the correct derived class to
 instantiate 
 3- Call Factory method during the runtime to instantiate the object
 that you need
