 * reason, the declaration of getFirstName() is invalid because it includes
 * an @Override annotation and there is no such method inherited. Since the code
 * does not compile. For the exam, you donâ€™t need to know how to create
 * annotations but you need to know when the common ones are incorrectly used.
 * If the annotation were removed, then the code would print null at runtime.
