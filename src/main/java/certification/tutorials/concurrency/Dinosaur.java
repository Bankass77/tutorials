 * thread, the first distance++ is executed, but the second is not. For this
 * reason, the maximum value printed is 10. We say maximum, because the volatile
 * instance variable distance is not thread-safe. Itâ€™s possible the same value
 * could be written twice. Note that using CopyOnWriteArrayList over a regular
 * ArrayList has no impact on this program.
